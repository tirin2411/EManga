            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one:
            a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all
            the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none,
            is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it,
            will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
